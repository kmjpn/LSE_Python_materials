    "Python's popularity has seen a remarkable rise since its inception in the late 1990's and has established itself as one of the most widely used languages in the last 10 years. It is currently ranked as one of the top 2 programming languages by the most common programming language rankings. It is now widely used not only for Data Science, where it is leading the field together with R, but also to develop software in a more general sense. If you would like to learn more about how Python can be applied for Data Science and why it has evolved to one of the most popular programming languages overall, have a look at [this section](https://dsl-python-presessional.streamlit.app/Why_Learn_Python) of the Python \n",

    "<p>For total programming beginners, we firmly discourage the use of ChatGPT to learn fundamental coding concepts. However, if you're transitioning from R to Python, while ChatGPT can be a valuable resource, be wary of becoming overly reliant on it. Writing code in Python often demands a deeper understanding of loops and crafting custom functions, compared to R's more straightforward syntax. Relying too much on automated help can hinder your ability to grasp and master these nuances. Ensure you balance assistance with genuine self-effort for optimal learning.</p>\n",
