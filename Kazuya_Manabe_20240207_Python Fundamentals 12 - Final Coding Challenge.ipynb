    "The Python pre-sessional workshops will teach you the fundamental data types and programming techniques that are necessary to succeed on any real-world coding project/challenge. The knowledge and skills that you develop in this series will form the foundation for any data analysis, visualisation or software development project in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python's popularity has seen a remarkable rise since its inception in the late 1990's and has established itself as one of the most widely used languages in the last 10 years. It is currently ranked as one of the top 2 programming languages by the most common programming language rankings. It is now widely used not only for Data Science, where it is leading the field together with R, but also to develop software in a more general sense. If you would like to learn more about how Python can be applied for Data Science and why it has evolved to one of the most popular programming languages overall, have a look at [this section](https://dsl-python-presessional.streamlit.app/Why_Learn_Python) of the Python \n",
    "#### Program WORDLE in Python\n",

    "In the final step of the Python Fundamental series, you will apply your Python skills to create WORDLE in Python. To develop Wordle in Python, you will have to combine most of the techniques that you have learned in the notebooks in a creative way.\n",

    "The Python Fundamentals series consists of 10 different jupyter notebooks that each teach a different topic. After having completed the series you can claim an online certificate to provide evidence of your Python skills on e.g. LinkdedIN. Please email digital.skills.lab@lse.ac.uk to claim your certificate. \n",

Learners that have completed all Python notebooks apart from the coding challenges notebook, can claim the Python Fundamentals Attendance Badge, which provides evidence of you having completed all exercises apart from the coding challenge. Learners that have completed *at least one* of the coding challenges, can claim the Python Fundamentals Knowledge Badge. This badge provides evidence of having successfully applied the fundamental Python skills to a more complex coding project. This is to highlight that in order to solve the final coding challenges a deeper understanding of the acquired coding techniques and advanced proficiency in their practical application are required.\n",

    "4. You can use the `clear_output()` function from the `IPython.display` module in jupyter to clear the output of a code cell on each iteration.

    "- Select a word from the wordle_words.txt randomly\n",
    "- Print 6 lines of placeholder words as in the example gif\n",
    "- Prompt the user to enter a 5-letter word\n",
    "- Display a coulored version of the entered word (letter in correct position: green, letter in wrong position: yellow)\n",

    "1. Read in the wordle_words.txt file as a list. You first have to read the file in and then split the string into a list based on linebreaks.\n",

    "2. Select an element from the list randomly as the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a variable for the maximum number of guesses.\n",

    "6. Write a function that prints each of the six guesses in a separate line.\n",

    "7. Start a while loop that:\n",
    "    - Prints the guesses.\n",
    "    - Ask the user to enter their guess.\n",

    "8. Write two separate functions that print a string in green and yellow respectively. \n",
    "    - A string preceded by the `GREEN` string will be printed in green.\n",
    "    - A string preceded by the `YELLOW` string will be printed in yellow.\n",
    "    - A string preceded by the `END` string will be printed in black.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Write a feedback function that uses the green and yellow function to return a coloured version of the word that the player entered.\n",
    "    - Any character from the solution that is in the correct position should be in green.\n",
    "    - Any character from the solution that is in the wrong position should be in yellow.\n",
