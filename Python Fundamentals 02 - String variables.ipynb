    "\n",
    "The Python pre-sessional workshops will teach you the fundamental data types and programming techniques that are necessary to succeed on any real-world coding project/challenge. The knowledge and skills that you develop in this series will form the foundation for any data analysis, visualisation or software development project in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the Python pre-sessional workshops and instructions on how to install Python on your personal laptop, have a look at the [Python Pre-sessional website](https://dsl-python-presessional.streamlit.app/)\n",

    "### Why learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's popularity has seen a remarkable rise since its inception in the late 1990's and has established itself as one of the most widely used languages in the last 10 years. It is currently ranked as one of the top 2 programming languages by the most common programming language rankings. It is now widely used not only for Data Science, where it is leading the field together with R, but also to develop software in a more general sense. If you would like to learn more about how Python can be applied for Data Science and why it has evolved to one of the most popular programming languages overall, have a look at [this section](https://dsl-python-presessional.streamlit.app/Why_Learn_Python) of the Python Pre-Sessional website.\n",

    "#### Program WORDLE in Python\n",

After having completed the series you can claim an online certificate to provide evidence of your Python skills on e.g. LinkdedIN. Please email digital.skills.lab@lse.ac.uk to claim your certificate. \n",

    "There are two types of certificates you can claim. Learners that have completed all Python notebooks apart from the coding challenges notebook, can claim the Python Fundamentals Attendance Badge, which provides evidence of you having completed all exercises apart from the coding challenge. Learners that have completed *at least one* of the coding challenges, can claim the Python Fundamentals Knowledge Badge. This badge provides evidence of having successfully applied the fundamental Python skills to a more complex coding project. This is to highlight that in order to solve the final coding challenges a deeper understanding of the acquired coding techniques and advanced proficiency in their practical application are required.\n",

    "<p>For total programming beginners, we firmly discourage the use of ChatGPT to learn fundamental coding concepts. However, if you're transitioning from R to Python, while ChatGPT can be a valuable resource, be wary of becoming overly reliant on it. Writing code in Python often demands a deeper understanding of loops and crafting custom functions, compared to R's more straightforward syntax. Relying too much on automated help can hinder your ability to grasp and master these nuances. Ensure you balance assistance with genuine self-effort for optimal learning.</p>\n",
