    "\n",
    "The Python pre-sessional workshops will teach you the fundamental data types and programming techniques that are necessary to succeed on any real-world coding project/challenge. The knowledge and skills that you develop in this series will form the foundation for any data analysis, visualisation or software development project in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the Python pre-sessional workshops and instructions on how to install Python on your personal laptop, have a look at the [Python Pre-sessional website](https://dsl-python-presessional.streamlit.app/)\n",

    "### Why learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's popularity has seen a remarkable rise since its inception in the late 1990's and has established itself as one of the most widely used languages in the last 10 years. It is currently ranked as one of the top 2 programming languages by the most common programming language rankings. It is now widely used not only for Data Science, where it is leading the field together with R, but also to develop software in a more general sense. If you would like to learn more about how Python can be applied for Data Science and why it has evolved to one of the most popular programming languages overall, have a look at [this section](https://dsl-python-presessional.streamlit.app/Why_Learn_Python) of the Python Pre-Sessional website.\n",

    "#### Program WORDLE in Python\n",

Please email digital.skills.lab@lse.ac.uk to claim your certificate. \n",

Learners that have completed all Python notebooks apart from the coding challenges notebook, can claim the Python Fundamentals Attendance Badge, which provides evidence of you having completed all exercises apart from the coding challenge. Learners that have completed *at least one* of the coding challenges, can claim the Python Fundamentals Knowledge Badge. This badge provides evidence of having successfully applied the fundamental Python skills to a more complex coding project. This is to highlight that in order to solve the final coding challenges a deeper understanding of the acquired coding techniques and advanced proficiency in their practical application are required.\n",

    "<p>For total programming beginners, we firmly discourage the use of ChatGPT to learn fundamental coding concepts. However, if you're transitioning from R to Python, while ChatGPT can be a valuable resource, be wary of becoming overly reliant on it. Writing code in Python often demands a deeper understanding of loops and crafting custom functions, compared to R's more straightforward syntax. Relying too much on automated help can hinder your ability to grasp and master these nuances. Ensure you balance assistance with genuine self-effort for optimal learning.</p>\n",

    "## Why use functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using functions makes code easier to read for you, collaborators or users. It provides a way to split your script into separate sections for each function.  We can reuse our functions throughout our script to perform the same task. If we would create another subset for the music app data, we can use the functions for that, which would make it easier to identify that the code performs the same task at different points in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you identify a bug in your function it is also easier to fix, since the code isn't used in multiple points in your script, but only where the function is defined. Using functions also saves a lot of key-strokes or copy-pasting chunks of chode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of functions is that they can be packaged and made available to other programmers or for your self centrally through your python distribution.\n",

    "1. Complete the `summary()` function. The function takes as input the values from a column and is then supposed to calculate the mean, median and standard deviation using the `mean()`, `median` and `stdev()` function from the **statistics** package. Combine the statistics into a dictionary and return the dictionary.\n",
    "2. Use the `summary()` function to calculate the mean, median and standard deviation of the rating column.\n",
